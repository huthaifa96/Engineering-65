# Fantasy League

## Project Overview

This application will allow users to create football teams and players into a fantasy league by  adding it to an already existing database. When the user selects a player, the player's attributes such as name, age, height, strongest foot and position will appear. Also, the player's statistics like the number of goals scored and assisted will appear along with the number of trophies they have won so far throughout their career. These are all stored in the players and players statistics tables.

When a team is selected, the team description and the number of trophies won will be on show. This information is stored in the teams table in the database. The application will have a feature where it'll show you the most successful player and team in the database by selecting the team/player with the most trophies won.

## Sprints

#### Sprint 1

##### Sprint Goals

The goals for this sprint was to complete the GitHub Project Board where all project backlog, sprint backlog and the definition of Done was completed. Then it was to create the database and insert data in the database.

##### Sprint Review

Creating the database was completed quite quickly whilst also doing most of the Project Board. However, not all the sprint goals could be achieved due to the lack of knowledge on how the different layers work and how to create a good functional GUI.

##### Sprint Retrospective

The major blocker of this sprint was the lack knowledge heading into the project. A university exam on Friday and revising for a C# data test on Tuesday put me back so I had to spend most of sprint 1 refreshing myself on the different CRUD operations and how to create a good, functional GUI. This was done by watching various videos on the likes of YouTube and the Microsoft Stream.

####Sprint 2

##### Sprint Goals

The goal for this sprint is to carry out and complete the different CRUD operations whilst also designing a wireframe for the application homepage.
